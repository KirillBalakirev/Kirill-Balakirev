        <p>Tutorials Point originated from the idea that there exists a class of 
        readers who respond better to online content and prefer to learn new 
        skills at their own pace from the comforts of their drawing rooms. 
        The journey commenced with a single tutorial on HTML in  2006 and elated 
        by the response it generated, we worked our way to adding fresh tutorials 
        to our repository which now proudly flaunts a wealth of tutorials and 
        allied articles on topics ranging from programming languages to web designing 
        to academics and much more..</p>
