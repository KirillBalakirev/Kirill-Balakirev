       <p>Tutorials Point originated from the idea that there exists a class of 
       readers who respond better to online content and prefer to learn new 
       skills at their own pace from the comforts of their drawing rooms. 
       The journey commenced with a single tutorial on HTML in  2006 and elated 
       by the response it generated, we worked our way to adding fresh tutorials 
       to our repository which now proudly flaunts a wealth of tutorials and 
       allied articles on topics ranging from programming languages to web designing 
       to academics and much more..</p>
