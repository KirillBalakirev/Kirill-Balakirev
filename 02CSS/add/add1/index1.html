        <p>Tutorials Point originated from the idea that there exists a class of 
            readers who respond better to online content and prefer to learn new 
            skills at their own pace from the comforts of their drawing rooms. 
            The journey commenced with a single tutorial on HTML in  2006 and elated 
            by the response it generated, we worked our way to adding fresh tutorials 
            to our repository which now proudly flaunts a wealth of tutorials and 
            allied articles on topics ranging from programming languages to web designing 
            to academics and much more..</p>
